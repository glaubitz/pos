TODO-List for POS/ARCH/C64:

11/12/02

all assembler code fragments:
- need to declare referenced kernel functions as "extern"
  or include kernel header files !

- boot.s
  nothing to do, is fully working, but give it some
  cosmetic refinements (both code and output)
- c64.h
  is okay, but add new definitions as
  soon as needed by new kernel features
- entry.s
  is actually complete, but has not been
  tested to work and not been adapted
  to all new kernel features yet
- irq.s
  MISSING: check for break-flag to tell a sw-irq from a hw-irq,
  it may also needed to support timer incrementing
- jmptable.h
  add new kernel function definitions when they arise (see POS/KERNEL/TODO.TXT)
- jmptable.s
  remove all location labels but the first one in this code, they
  are supercilious and not needed by the assembler
- nmi.s
  write the code here what the software should do when an NMI
  rises, i.e. CIA, Restore-Key or Expansion Port; proposal: system reset

note on jmptable.h and jmptable.s:

as the kernel design is still changing quite often during
development, the jumptable will be finally updated when
kernel-design is complete.
