GENERALLY:

Check out code for other architectures, they seem
to be a bit easier to understand, especially the
alpha initialization code !!



interesting:

include/asm/config.h
include/asm/current.h - code that returns current task
include/asm/atomic.h
include/asm/a.out.h
include/asm/desc.h
include/asm/ldt.h
include/asm/io.h
include/linux/init.h
include/asm/keyboard.h
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c
arch/i386/kernel/process.c
arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c (?)
arch/i386/kernel/signal.c
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S
arch/i386/kernel/head.S - the kernels "head" when loaded into mem (?)
arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c
arch/i386/kernel/trampoline.S (?)
arch/i386/kernel/i386_ksyms.c - kernel symbols

arch/alpha/boot/main.c

/* what does the preceding 'b' stand for ? */

arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S
arch/i386/boot/Setup.S
arch/i386/boot/bbootsect.S
arch/i386/boot/bsetup.S


// all code concerning task switching !!

// all code concerning atoms !

// all code concerning the mmu !
