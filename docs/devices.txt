NOTES on devices
jan., 28 2002
-------------

The kernel should always be requested by devices with
events and should not query all devices regularily
for new information. If a certain device does not support
this kind of i/o, then the device driver must contain
a IRQ-routine to query the device and to enable/disable
querying. This way the kernel will be confronted with
a feign support of device-events and the kernel-device
interface will be kept simple.

BTW: how about integrating a IRQ-routine into every driver
that can be registered ?? (but problem would be: kernel
will slow down by executing a big bunch of routines, NO
better NOT)
