* Notes on the kernel configuration utility
* 05/06/03

- the utility is used to easily manage the kernel
  configuration files; nevertheless these files can
  be edited manually

- the utility will be available in two versions, a
  text-based and a GUI-based version

- the utility must be written using portable code
  with libraries that exist on multiple platforms

- proposals:
  a) the text-based version should do i/o using the
     C standard libraries
  b) the GUI-based version should use the TK- or GTK-
     libraries

- current progress:
  a) the text-based version has not been started yet
  b) the GUI-based version is called tkconfig and
     can be found in the /tools-folder of the pOS
     source tree
