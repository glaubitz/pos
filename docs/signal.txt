Signals in pOS 0.0.1
--------------------

Signals are realized thru call-back functions which
will be called on leaving the timer-interrupt.


__64irq:

	/* other handlers here */

	cli
	jmp __current->signalfn [current->signal];


in schedule ():

	if (proc->signal && proc->state != UNINTERRUPTIBLE)
		proc->state = RUNNING;
