The kernel startup in kernel v0.0.1
05/17/01

Depending on the type of machine you are using
something may differ but the bulk startup
looks like this:

At first the computer loads the bootloader whose
code is assembled from the source of

/ARCH/<MACHINE>/BOOT.S

This is done on a C64 by typing

LOAD"BOOT",8<RETURN>
RUN<RETURN>

at the BASIC prompt.

this code loads the main kernel image into memory
and jumps to the kernel entry code that is
assembled from

/ARCH/<MACHINE>/ENTRY.S

this code sets-up interrupt and reset vectors
and other things necessary (i.e disabling of ROM-code),
then calls a routine called start_kernel ()
from /KERNEL/SYSINIT.C.

This routine sets up the rest kernel paramters
and then loads the program init from

/KERNEL/INIT/INIT.C

This small program will load the files "init.tab"
and "rc.config" which contain programs to load
and custom settings for the kernel (i.e font color).
