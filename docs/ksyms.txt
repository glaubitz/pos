* How kernel symbols are exported and made
* available for applications 
* jun., 25 2001

Kernel symbols are written to a map-file "kernel.map"
during kernel compilation. Then a small tool called
map2inc is invoked that creates a header file from
this map-file that is used by pos.c which is then
built with the symbols from header file.

NOTE on 09/02/2002:
for compatibility reasons between different kernel
versions i have decided to abandon this technique
for kernel symbols. we are now using a simple
jump-table at the top of the kernel code
(even before the entry-code). the first jump-
entry of this table calls the (re-)booting
code.
