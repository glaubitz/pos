pOS Kernel status - 12/19/04

Part				Complete	Lacks what ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filesystem Interface		60 %		code implementation (design complete)
Scheduler			40 %		code implementation (design almost complete), design refining
Memory Management		98 %		bug tracking, more tidyness (maybe mm is gonna rewritten - page-oriented)
Boot Loader			100 %		nothing (only cosmetics and code adaptions)
Process Management		50 %		file loading mechanisms, has lots of bugs
Device and Driver API		95 %		small design changes, code corrections
System Time Function		95 %		debugging
Console Driver			65 %		currently console output only (buggy), no input
Block Device Driver		 0 %		absolutely no idea how to contact 1541 :(, will be provisorical driver
Signals				10 %		only simple concept
Helper Libraries		70 %		simply to lazy to go on (concept is there)

and additionally the kernel probably has dozens of bugs (except for the bootloader strip
which has been tested to work perfectly :) )

Remaining design-todo:

- Scheduler refinements
- possible mm redesign
- device-files i/o (data written,
  update-flag etc)
- cheat driver for 1541 block device to use
  1541-DOS to access filesystem to speed-up
  disk access on C64)
