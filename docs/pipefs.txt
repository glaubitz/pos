Pipes in pOS - 06/15/05
-----------------------

The pipe-concept of pOS is the standard one used
in many -ix operating systems. A process calls
pipe which returns two file-structs, one for
reading and one for writing the pipe. The process
then can pass one of the structs to another process
for interprocess communication (IPC).

Pipe is simply a character device which consists mainly
of a FIFO-buffer which is written by one process
and read by another, of course the reading process
always calling suspend once the buffer is empty.
Those pipes are called named pipes in Unix.
