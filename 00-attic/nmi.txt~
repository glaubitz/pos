pOS - portable Operating System

NMI-Handler:

The NMI-Handler controls the process management.
(this is better done by IRQ handler ??)
It calls routines from the schedule.c to deter-
mine if the current process has still the prio-
rity to run, and exchanges the current process
if necessary.

This can only be done through the NMI since the
normal IRQ can be disabled by a normal process
with SEI.

To prevent a process exchange kernel routines can
call the scheduler function __lockactiveprocess.
Currently there is the problem that this function
has to be called immediately after a kernel function
was called that needs to determine the caller process.
